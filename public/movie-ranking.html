  <h1>The Best Films According to Dave</h1>
  <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
  <hr />

  <h3>Stardust</h3>
  <p>This is just a genuinely enjoyable film from start to finish. A great story, great characters, a fantastical universe. It has mini elephants and a crossdressing cloud pirate Robert DeNiro - what more could you want in a film? Stardust is also very meaningful to me as the first film I watched with my wife.</p>

  <h3>The Marvel Cinematic Universe</h3>
  <p>OK, technically it's not one film, but I adore the vast majority of the MCU films, especially the Avengers based films. All-star casts, dramatic set-pieces, top-tier CGI. They're just action-filled feel-good films that anyone can enjoy.</p>

  <h3>Armageddon</h3>
  <p>I can remember seeing this in the cinema. It was an absolutely riveting experience. It was such an emotional film. Obviously it's not based on real events, but the premise of the film; a planet-killing asteroid, on a collision course with Earth, is a plausible scenario. How Armageddon handles that concept - "let's send a team of rednecks into space, to drill into the asteroid, to plant a nuclear bomb" - is probably not how we would handle this sort of eventuality, but it does at least make a fun film.</p>
