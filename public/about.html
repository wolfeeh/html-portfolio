<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello! I'm Dave. I'm a 44 year old guy from the UK. I've been coding on and off for over 25 years. I'm mainly a hobbyist but I have studied programming and web design in university, but life took me down a different career path. I've created my own apps and websites and even used my skills for small projects in my current career.</p>

<p>Programming can be challenging but also fun. I stick with it as a hobby because I feel like it exercises the old brain cells. I think programming is a useful life-skill and it's an especially useful skill in many occupations, but it's not one that a lot of people actually have, so being able to code can put you at a massive advantage in a lot of different careers.</p>

<p>I have many little side projects I'd like to flesh out over time, but one of them is an application for my workplace, which, if I'm able to create my vision, will make my and my colleagues' lives so much easier. It's going to be a long road, and I'm going to need to learn a lot and really push myself out of my comfort zone, but it should be worth it in the end.</p>
